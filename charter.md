### 1. Purpose of COP

The Open Badges (OBs) Community of Practice (CoP) charter documents information required by decision makers to approve and support the activities necessary for a successful launch, cultivation, and sustainability of the CoP. The CoP charter includes the needs, scope, justification, and resource commitments.

The intended audience of the OBs CoP community charter is:

1. Community sponsors
2. Senior leadership
3. Community members

### 2. CoP Overview

A CoP is a group of people connected by a common cause, role or purpose, which operates in a common modality. CoPS are a way of developing new knowledge, stimulating innovation, and sharing knowledge. Communities of practice knit people together with peers and their outputs can include leading practices, guidelines, knowledge repositories, technical problem and solution discussions, and strategies. Each xAPI CoP represents a group of professionals, informally bound to one another through a common classification of xAPI vocabulary requirements and common pursuit of solutions to satisfy those requirements. 

## 3. Justification

### 3.1 Experience API (xAPI)

The xAPI specification was written to be flexible enough to meet the varying use cases of the eLearning community. This flexibility can lead to a degradation of interoperability if CoPs do not agree to certain conventions. These conventions and rules on how to use the xAPI can be decided upon by each CoP and applied to the base xAPI specification as profiles.

The xAPI CoPS will generate a controlled vocabulary lists and design profiles. Some xAPI CoPS may also leverage the work from external CoPs, depending upon the domain area.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 Mission

This CoP will work towards standardising an approach to issuing 'digital badges' as recognition of competence in a given field. This CoP addresses the problems of recording badges and evidence such that systems can interoperate with each other.

Community benefits:

1. Standardisation to allow systems to interoperate.
2. Overcome challenges that would cost members time and money.
3. Helps members reach and provide new opportunities.

### 4.2 Goals

This CoP will work towards standardising an approach to combining the xAPI with OBs such that the opportunities and challenges of the combination are addressed. The opportunities of xAPI with OBs are:

1. Analyse pathways to badges.
2. Issue portable badges (by allowing systems to interoperate over a standard API with a standard data model).
3. Provide evidence-based badges.

### 4.3 Activities & Deliverables

- [x] Establish Community and Register with ADL xAPI Directory
- [ ] Complete CoP Charter
- [ ] To agree a controlled vocab for the issuing of badges, to include a 'badge assertion' that meets the requirements of the Mozilla OB standard.
- [ ] To articulate a design profile for appending 'evidence' to an issued Badge, by way of xAPI statements.
- [ ] To publicise and gain broad agreement for our approach within the community.
- [ ] Provide CoP updates to ADL xAPI CoP
