### 1. Purpose of COP

The Open Badges Community of Practice (CoP) charter documents information required by decision makers to approve and support the activities necessary for a successful launch, cultivation, and sustainability of the Community of Practice. The CoP charter includes the needs, scope, justification, and resource commitments.

The intended audience of the Open Badges Community of Practice community charter is the community sponsors, senior leadership, and the community members.

### 2. CoP Overview

A CoP is a group of people connected by a common cause, role or purpose, which operates in a common modality. CoPS are a way of developing new knowledge, stimulating innovation, and sharing knowledge. Communities of practice knit people together with peers and their outputs can include leading practices, guidelines, knowledge repositories, technical problem and solution discussions, and strategies. Each xAPI CoP represents a group of professionals, informally bound to one another through a common classification of xAPI vocabulary requirements and common pursuit of solutions to satisfy those requirements. 

Community benefits:

1. Standardisation to allow systems to interoperate.
2. Overcome challenges that would cost members time and money.
3. Helps members reach and provide new opportunities.

## 3. Justification

### 3.1 Experience API (xAPI)

The xAPI specification was written to be flexible enough to meet the varying use cases of the eLearning community. This flexibility can lead to a degradation of interoperability if CoPs do not agree to certain conventions. These conventions and rules on how to use the xAPI can be decided upon by each CoP and applied to the base xAPI specification as profiles.

The xAPI CoPS will generate a controlled vocabulary lists and design profiles. Some xAPI CoPS may also leverage the work from external CoPs, depending upon the domain area.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 Mission

This community of practice will work towards standardising an approach to issuing 'digital badges' as recognition of competence in a given field. This CoP addresses the problems of recording badges and evidence such that systems can interoperate with each other.

### 4.2 Goals

Initially we will work to the Mozilla Open Badge standard for issuing portable, evidence-based digital badges. Our work will focus on following initial objectives:

1. To agree a controlled vocab for the issuing of badges, to include a 'badge assertion' that meets the requirements of the Mozilla Open Badge standard.
2. To articulate a design profile for appending 'evidence' to an issued Badge, by way of xAPI statements.
3. To publicise and gain broad agreement for our approach within the community.

### 4.3 Activities & Deliverables

- [x] Establish Community and Register with ADL xAPI Directory
- [ ] Complete Community of Practice Charter
- [ ] Develop OB xAPI Controlled Vocabulary
- [ ] Develop OB Design Profiles
- [ ] Provide CoP updates to ADL xAPI CoP
