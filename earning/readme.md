# OB Earning
When combining the [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md) with [Open Badges (OBs)](http://openbadges.org/), `actors` can **earn** OBs, where an OB is an online representation of a skill. This directory defines the [vocabulary](vocab.md) and provides [examples](#resources) of the best practices defined by this CoP for OB Earning.
