# Open Badges Extension Details
This section outlines two extensions to Open Badges for inclusion of xAPI criteria and evidence 
data within a Badge Class and Badge Assertion. 

<a name="xapi-criteria">
## xAPI Criteria
'xapi-criteria' is an extension of the OB Badge Class. This property is equivelent to the 'xapi-criteria'
property included in the Badge Class extension [described here](xapi-extensions.md#badge-class); the contents of both
properties (within the badge and within the statement) are the same. 

<a name="xapi-evidence">
## xAPI Evidence
'xapi-evidence' is an extension of the OB Badge Assertion. Contains a [Badge Evidence object](xapi-extensions.md#badge-evidence).
