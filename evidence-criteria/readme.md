# OB Earning
It is possible to define the criteria and evidence supporting an [Open Badge (OB)](http://openbadges.org/) as 
[xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md) statements. This recipe enables the definition
of Badges to be transmitted between systems such that a badge defined within one system can be awarded within another. 

This directory defines the [vocabulary](vocab.md) and provides [examples](#resources) of the best practices defined by this CoP for OB Evidence and Criteria.
