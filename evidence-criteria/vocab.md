TO BE COMPLETED. DO NOT IMPLEMENT!

# Vocabulary
This document defines the identifiers and extensions used for OB evidence and criteria. 
Examples can be found in the [readme](readme.md) of this directory.

This Vocabulary builds on the vocabulary defined for [OB Earning](../earning/). The 'earn'
statement should therefore include recipe ids for both this recipe and [OB Earning](../earning/)
version 0.0.2 (or whichever version you are using if you are using a later version; note that
later versions of the Earning recipe may or may not be compatible).
