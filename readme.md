This community of practice will work towards standardising an approach to issuing 'digital badges' as recognition of competence in a given field. Initially we will work to the Mozilla Open Badge standard for issuing portable, evidence-based digital badges. Our work will focus on following initial objectives:

1. To agree a controlled vocab for the issuing of badges, to include a 'badge assertion' that meets the requirements of the Mozilla Open Badge standard.
2. To articulate a design profile for appending 'evidence' to an issued Badge, by way of xAPI statements.
3. To publicise and gain broad agreement for our approach within the community.
