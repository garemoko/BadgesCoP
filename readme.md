> [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md) [Community of Practice](http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/xapi-cop-directory/) for [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/)

This community of practice (CoP) will work towards standardising an approach to combining the xAPI with Open Badges (OBs). Initially we will work to the Mozilla Open Badge standard.

Opportunities of xAPI with Open Badges:

1. Analyse pathways to badges.
2. Issue portable badges (by allowing systems to interoperate over a standard API with a standard data model).
3. Provide evidence-based badges.

Community benefits:

1. Standardisation to allow systems to interoperate.
2. Overcome challenges that would cost you time and money.
2. Helps you reach and provide new opportunities. 


Initial objectives:

1. To agree a controlled vocab for the issuing of badges, to include a 'badge assertion' that meets the requirements of the Mozilla Open Badge standard.
2. To articulate a design profile for appending 'evidence' to an issued Badge, by way of xAPI statements.
3. To publicise and gain broad agreement for our approach within the community.
